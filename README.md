# Getting started
Welcome to the Hennig materials theory group! This repository exists to help
new users to understand the computational methods being used in the group and
to get started researching their own materials.

# How to use this repository
You'll notice that there are only two folders here:
``objectives`` and ``examples``. ``objectives`` has a bunch of files that each have a list of objectives
that you should go through one at a time. There's no pressure to finish all
of these quickly, but the sooner you get started on them the sooner you'll be
able to run actual calculations. These objectives include things like opening an
account on Hipergator and/or Stampede (the main supercomputers our group uses
for our calculations), and completing the Python tutorial on Codecademy.

While you're working your way through the objectives, you'll be instructed
to start working on the examples in the ``examples`` folder. Most of these
examples are pretty generic, so you can feel free to consult with Dr. Hennig or
your mentor about which examples will be most useful to you for the research
you will eventually do.

If you have any questions or run into any issues with the examples, please post
an issue to the issues page.

Cheers!
