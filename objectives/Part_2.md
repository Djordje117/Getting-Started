# Part 2: Learn Linux and Python
You haven't left the group after day one, which is a great sign!

The objectives for this part don't require you to have any Hipergator or Stampede account, so they're great for doing while you're waiting on your accounts getting set up.

----------

1. Now would be a great time to start learning Linux/command line and Python, if you don't already. Our favorite resource for learning different languages is Codecademy, which has excellent free courses on both [Linux](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) and [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). You will almost definitely be using both of these syntaxes while you're working in the group- Linux/command line is for navigation on your computer and Python is for pretty much everything else. You will get a lot more comfortable with them over time, but these courses will help you get started.
It might take you a week or two to finish these courses, so don't feel like you need to finish them to advance to the next objectives. You can keep working on these courses as you advance through the objectives.
