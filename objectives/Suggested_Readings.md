# Suggested Readings

Below is a list of papers and textbooks that will help you understand some of the theory behind the calculations you'll be performing in your research. Don't feel like you need to read all of them!

----------
## Textbooks
Dr. Hennig has copies of most of these; just ask.

- [Density Functional Theory: A Practical Introduction (Sholl and Steckel)](https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1118211049)
- [Solid State Physics (Ashcroft and Mermin)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Solid_State_Physics.html?id=oXIfAQAAMAAJ)
- [Introduction to Solid State Physics (Kittel)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_Solid_State_Physics.html?id=kym4QgAACAAJ)
- [Computer Simulation of Liquids (Allen and Tildesley)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Computer_Simulation_of_Liquids.html?id=O32VXB9e5P4C)

## Our group's research papers
All of our group's research papers are listed on [Dr. Hennig's publications page](http://hennig.mse.ufl.edu/publications/). Naturally, some will be more relevant to your project than others.

## Guide for writing research papers
Dr. John Wilkins from Ohio State has written a [helpful guide for writing research papers in physics](http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/writing/).
